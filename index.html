      <h2>How we do it</h2>

      <p>Our structure guides us, but never constrains us. Here are the four pillars of our approach.</p>

      <dl>

        <dt><span class="term">Exploring</span> <span class="phrase">the unique brand opportunity</span></dt>
        <dd>
          <div class="pullquote">01</div>
          <p>Opportunities. Every brand has them. <span class="companyname">INVIVO BRANDS</span> uncovers the right ones based on the market, the competition, and the white space within. Then we help brands live up to their potential with an ownable promise and platform.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><span class="term">Defining</span> <span class="phrase">the brand position</span></dt>
        <dd>
          <div class="pullquote">02</div>
          <p>A brand's position is the underpinning of everything it says and does. What will your brand stand for? How will it sound? How will it make people feel? What will it make them do? <span class="companyname">INVIVO BRANDS</span> will help you answer all of that&mdash;and more.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><span class="term">Crafting</span> <span class="phrase">the brand story</span></dt>
        <dd>
          <div class="pullquote">03</div>
          <p>Once a brand finds its voice, it needs to tell a cohesive story. But before a brand can start talking to someone&mdash;and expect them to listen&mdash;it needs to connect with them in an authentic, meaningful, and relevant way. It needs to create a relationship. <span class="companyname">INVIVO BRANDS</span> will foster those connections from day one by creating stories that shift behavior and encourage action.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><span class="term">Implementing</span> <span class="phrase">bring it all to life</span></dt>
        <dd>
          <div class="pullquote">04</div>
          <p>We don't have to tell you just how fragmented, fast-paced, and hyper-connected our world is today. Which is why we have to work so much harder&mdash;and smarter&mdash;to not only intercept people where they are, but give them a real reason to pay attention. <span class="companyname">INVIVO BRANDS</span> will craft communication plans that get the attention of your audience&mdash;and keep it.  </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>No matter the medium, <span class="companyname">INVIVO BRANDS</span> creates integrated communications plans that seamlessly fit into peoples' lives, wherever they are. And we're constantly tightening the screws on our campaigns, testing and learning and making them more intelligent over time.</p>
